# MindStash: Build in Public - Ready to Execute Plan

> **Goal:** Create engagement, build an audience, and generate waitlist signups WHILE building MindStash.
>
> **Mindset:** You're not selling software. You're sharing a journey that every knowledge worker relates to - the frustration of losing thoughts. People follow the builder, then buy the product.

## The Core Story (Your Narrative)

Every piece of content you post should trace back to ONE relatable truth:

**"We all lose brilliant thoughts every single day. I'm building an AI that makes sure you never do."**

This is your anchor. Not "I'm building a SaaS." Not "I'm using RAG and tool calling." The HUMAN problem first, the tech second.

### Why People Will Care

Think about your audience's daily life:

- They're in the shower and think of a startup idea. Gone by breakfast.
- They read an article and think "I should try this." Never do.
- A friend recommends a restaurant. They forget the name by evening.
- They set a mental reminder to call someone. They don't.
- They want to learn Docker. The thought dies in a Twitter scroll.

**Everyone has this problem. Nobody has solved it well.** Notes apps require manual organization. Bookmarks become graveyards. Todo apps feel like work.

MindStash is different: dump the thought, AI does the rest.

## Content Pillars (4 Themes You Rotate Between)

Every post you make falls into one of these 4 buckets:

### Pillar 1: "The Problem" (Relatability)
Posts that make people nod and say "That's ME."
- Share the pain of losing thoughts
- Statistics about forgotten ideas
- Memes about bookmark graveyards
- Screenshots of chaotic notes apps

### Pillar 2: "The Build" (Technical Journey)
Posts that show what you're building and how.
- Before/after screenshots
- Architecture decisions explained simply
- "Today I built..." progress updates
- Code snippets with context
- Technical challenges and how you solved them

### Pillar 3: "The AI Magic" (Wow Factor)
Posts that show the AI doing something impressive.
- Demo videos of AI categorizing thoughts
- "I typed X, AI understood Y" examples
- Showing AI predicting reminders
- RAG finding forgotten thoughts
- Agent planning your week

### Pillar 4: "The Lessons" (Value-First Content)
Posts that teach something useful, with MindStash as context.
- "How I implemented RAG in my side project"
- "What I learned building with Claude API"
- "Tool calling explained with a real example"
- Tech stack decisions and why

**Ratio:** 30% Problem, 30% Build, 25% AI Magic, 15% Lessons

## Platform Strategy

### Primary: Twitter/X
- Where #buildinpublic lives
- Daily posts (short, visual, relatable)
- Thread format for deeper content
- Best for developer + maker audience

### Secondary: LinkedIn
- Professional angle ("AI engineering" content)
- 2-3 posts per week
- Longer format, more storytelling
- Best for reaching non-developers who NEED this product

### Launch: Product Hunt
- One-time launch event
- Prepare 2 weeks in advance
- Best for initial user surge

### Community: Reddit
- r/SideProject, r/webdev, r/artificial, r/MachineLearning
- Share milestones, not promotions
- Best for honest feedback

### Blog: Dev.to or Hashnode
- Technical deep dives
- 1-2 posts per month
- Best for SEO and credibility

---

## Phase 1: Pre-Build Hype (Week 1-2)

**Goal:** Establish the problem. Make people feel the pain. No product yet, just the story.

### Post 1: The Origin Story

**Platform:** Twitter thread + LinkedIn

```
I lose at least 3 good ideas every single day.

Not because I'm forgetful. Because there's nowhere
to quickly dump a thought and trust it'll be organized.

Notes app? Chaos after 2 weeks.
Bookmarks? A graveyard I never revisit.
Todo apps? They feel like work, not thinking.

So I'm building something different.

An AI-powered second brain that:
- Takes any thought in plain text (under 500 chars)
- AI instantly categorizes it (tasks, ideas, read later, goals...)
- Predicts WHEN to remind you
- Resurfaces forgotten thoughts at the right time

I'm calling it MindStash.

I'm building it in public. Follow along.

#buildinpublic #ai #saas
```

---

### Post 2: The Relatable Pain Point

**Platform:** Twitter (standalone)

```
Your brain right now:

- "I should learn Docker" (forgets in 2 hours)
- "That restaurant looks good" (forgets the name)
- "Call John about Sunday" (remembers Monday)
- "Great article about RAG" (lost in 200 bookmarks)
- "What if I built an app that..." (gone forever)

This is why I'm building MindStash.

Dump any thought. AI organizes it. Never lose it again.

Building in public, day 3.
```

---

### Post 3: The "What If" Question

**Platform:** Twitter + LinkedIn

```
What if your notes app actually understood what you saved?

Not just stored text. Actually UNDERSTOOD it.

"Call John about the football match on Sunday"

A regular notes app: saves text. Done.

MindStash AI:
  Category: People
  Intent: Contact someone
  Urgency: High (Sunday is close)
  Action required: Yes
  Reminder: Saturday evening (day before)

That's the difference between storing and understanding.

Building this right now. #buildinpublic
```

---

### Post 4: The Graveyard Post

**Platform:** Twitter (visual - screenshot your own bookmarks/notes mess)

```
This is my bookmarks folder. 847 items. I've revisited maybe 12.

This is my Apple Notes. 200+ notes. No organization.

This is my "Read Later" list. 3 years of articles I'll never read.

Sound familiar?

The problem isn't saving. It's RESURFACING.

MindStash doesn't just save your thoughts.
It brings them back at the right time.

Building this in public. Week 1.
```

---

## Phase 2: Building in Public (Week 3-6)

**Goal:** Show progress. Make people invested in the journey. Every post shows something REAL.

### Post 5: First Working Demo

**Platform:** Twitter (with video/GIF)

```
Day 12 of building MindStash.

The AI categorization is WORKING.

I typed: "Need to buy a birthday gift for mom next week"

AI returned:
  Category: Buy
  Urgency: High
  Reminder: Set for next Thursday
  Tags: #family #shopping #birthday

It UNDERSTOOD the deadline. It SET the reminder.
I didn't configure anything.

[attach 15-second screen recording]

#buildinpublic
```

---

### Post 6: The "12 Categories" Post

**Platform:** Twitter thread

```
I taught my AI to sort every human thought into 12 categories.

Here's what I learned about how we think:

1. Read - "Check out this article about..."
2. Watch - "I should watch that video on..."
3. Ideas - "What if we built a..."
4. Tasks - "I need to..."
5. People - "Remind me to call..."
6. Notes - "Remember that the default is..."
7. Goals - "By December I want to..."
8. Buy - "I need a new..."
9. Places - "Let's try that restaurant..."
10. Journal - "Today I felt..."
11. Learn - "I should learn how to..."
12. Save - "Bookmark this for later"

Turns out, most of our daily thoughts fit into
these 12 buckets. And the AI gets it right 90%+ of the time.

The magic: you don't choose the category. You just type naturally.
AI figures out the rest.

That's MindStash. Building in public.
```

---

### Post 7: Architecture Post (Technical Audience)

**Platform:** Twitter thread + Dev.to blog

```
How I built AI categorization for MindStash
(and what I learned about prompt engineering)

The stack:
- FastAPI (Python backend)
- Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast + cheap)
- PostgreSQL with pgvector (embeddings)
- Next.js 16 + React 19 (frontend)

The interesting part:

My AI doesn't just label content. It returns 20+ signals:
- category, tags, summary
- urgency, priority, intent
- action_required (boolean)
- time_context (immediate/next_week/someday)
- resurface_strategy (when to show it again)
- notification_date (AI PREDICTS when to remind you)

Cost per categorization: $0.0015

That's 666 thoughts organized for $1.

Thread below on how I built each piece...
```

---

### Post 8: The Smart Resurfacing Post

**Platform:** Twitter + LinkedIn

```
The hardest problem in note-taking isn't saving.
It's remembering to look at what you saved.

My solution: Smart Resurfacing.

MindStash's "Today" tab doesn't show today's items.
It shows items the AI thinks you NEED today:

- Urgent tasks you haven't acted on
- Learning items you saved 7 days ago (time to revisit)
- Action items nobody's surfaced in 3 days
- High-priority items (always visible)

The AI decides what to bring back and when.

You saved "Learn Docker" 2 weeks ago?
It pops back up as a gentle nudge.

You saved "Call mom this weekend"?
It appears Friday evening.

That's the difference between a note app and a second brain.

#buildinpublic #mindstash
```

---

### Post 9: Weekly Progress Update (Repeat Every Week)

**Platform:** Twitter

```
MindStash Week 3 update:

Built:
- Semantic search (find thoughts by MEANING, not keywords)
- "What was that restaurant?" actually FINDS it now
- Agent can search, create, and update items via chat

Numbers:
- 23 commits this week
- 3 new API endpoints
- 1,247 lines of code
- $2.40 spent on AI API calls

Next week:
- Chat interface (talk to your second brain)
- Voice capture (save thoughts by speaking)

Biggest lesson this week:
pgvector similarity search is shockingly easy to set up.
4 lines of SQL. That's it.

#buildinpublic
```

---

### Post 10: The Agentic AI Post (Wow Factor)

**Platform:** Twitter thread + LinkedIn

```
I just turned my note-taking app into an AI agent.

Instead of just SAVING thoughts, you can now TALK to them.

Me: "What ideas did I have about AI this month?"

MindStash Agent:
  [searches my 200+ saved items]
  [finds 5 AI-related ideas]
  [summarizes them]

  "You saved 5 ideas about AI:
   1. AI-powered meal planner (Jan 15)
   2. Resume analyzer with Claude (Jan 20)
   3. Voice-to-task app (Jan 25)
   4. AI code reviewer (Feb 1)
   5. Automated blog writer (Feb 8)

   I notice 3 of these are about productivity tools.
   Want me to group them into a project?"

It doesn't just retrieve. It THINKS about what it found.

This is RAG + Tool Calling + Memory working together.

Thread on how I built this...
```

---

## Phase 3: Waitlist & Anticipation (Week 5-8)

**Goal:** Convert followers into waitlist signups. Create FOMO.

### Post 11: Waitlist Launch

**Platform:** Twitter + LinkedIn + Reddit

```
MindStash is almost ready.

Quick recap if you're new here:
- Type any thought (max 500 characters)
- AI categorizes it into 12 smart categories
- AI predicts when to remind you
- AI resurfaces forgotten thoughts
- Chat with your saved thoughts like talking to a friend

I'm opening a waitlist for early access.

First 100 users get:
- Free access during beta
- Direct line to me for feedback
- Your name in the "Early Believers" section

Link in bio.

#buildinpublic
```

---

### Post 12: Social Proof / Demo Day

**Platform:** Twitter (video)

```
30 seconds of MindStash in action:

0:00 - Type "Buy birthday gift for mom next Friday"
0:05 - AI categorizes: Buy, High urgency
0:08 - Card appears in dashboard with tags
0:12 - Reminder auto-set for Thursday evening
0:15 - Switch to "Today" tab - urgent items surfaced
0:20 - Open chat: "What do I need to buy?"
0:25 - Agent lists all "buy" items with context
0:30 - Done. Zero manual organization.

This is what a second brain looks like.

Waitlist link in bio. 200+ people already signed up.
```

---

## Phase 4: Launch (Week 8-10)

### Product Hunt Launch Plan

**2 Weeks Before:**
- [ ] Create Product Hunt upcoming page
- [ ] Ask 10-15 friends/followers to follow the upcoming page
- [ ] Prepare 5 high-quality screenshots
- [ ] Record 60-second demo video
- [ ] Write maker comment (your story, why you built this)
- [ ] Prepare launch day posts for all platforms

**Launch Day Post:**

```
After 8 weeks of building in public, MindStash is LIVE.

What it does:
You type a thought. AI organizes your life.

- 12 smart categories (AI picks the right one)
- Predicted reminders (AI knows when to nudge you)
- Smart resurfacing (forgotten ideas come back)
- Chat with your memory (ask questions about what you saved)

Built with:
FastAPI + Next.js + Claude AI + pgvector

This started as a side project to solve MY problem.
847 lost bookmarks. 200 messy notes. Thousands of forgotten ideas.

Today it's a product.

Would love your support on Product Hunt:

## Engagement Tactics (How to Get People to Respond)

### 1. Ask Questions at the End
Don't just broadcast. Pull people in.

```
Bad:  "I built AI categorization today. #buildinpublic"
Good: "I built AI categorization today. It handles 12 categories.
       But I'm debating: should I add a 13th for 'health/fitness'?
       What category do YOU wish your notes app had?"
```

### 2. Show Vulnerability
People follow humans, not products.

```
"Spent 4 hours debugging why my AI returned 'buy' for
'I should learn Python.' Turns out my prompt had a bug
that made everything with 'should' map to shopping.

Lesson: Always test your prompts with adversarial inputs.

What's the dumbest bug you've shipped? Make me feel better."
```

### 3. Before/After Format
The most engaging format on Twitter.

```
Before MindStash:
- Open Notes app
- Create new note
- Think of a title
- Choose a folder
- Type the thought
- Forget it exists forever

After MindStash:
- Type thought
- Done

AI handles the rest.
```

### 4. Share Real Numbers
Transparency builds trust.

```
MindStash Month 1 in numbers:

Revenue: $0 (still building)
Waitlist: 47 signups
Commits: 156
AI API cost: $8.40 total
Lines of code: 12,400
Cups of coffee: too many
Times I wanted to quit: 3
Times I kept going: 3

See you next month.
```

### 5. Tag Relevant People
When you use a technology, tag the makers.

```
"Just implemented RAG using @pgvector and @AnthropicAI
Claude for my side project MindStash.

Semantic search over personal notes is incredible.
User types 'that video about containers' and it finds
the item that says 'Watch Docker tutorial by TechWorld.'

The future of search isn't keywords. It's meaning."
```

## The Non-Obvious Strategy: Teach While You Build

The posts that will get the MOST engagement aren't about MindStash. They're about **what you learned building it**.

People don't care about your product (yet). They care about what they can LEARN from you.

```
Post about MindStash:     50 likes
Post about "How I implemented RAG":  500 likes

Post about MindStash:     50 likes
Post about "Tool calling explained
with a real example":     1,000 likes
```

MindStash becomes the CONTEXT for educational content. You teach, they learn, they follow, they eventually try your product.

**Best performing content formats for developers building in public:**

1. "How I built X" (technical walkthrough)
2. "I made this mistake so you don't have to" (vulnerability)
3. "Before vs After" (visual transformation)
4. "X days building Y, here's what I learned" (journey recap)
5. "The AI did something unexpected" (surprise/delight)

## Final Note: Consistency Beats Virality

You don't need a viral post. You need to show up every day for 8 weeks.

The people who succeed building in public aren't the best marketers. They're the most consistent builders who share honestly.

**One post per day. Real progress. Real struggles. Real results.**

That's the entire strategy. Everything else is details.

Start today. Post #1 is the hardest. Post #50 is where the magic happens.
